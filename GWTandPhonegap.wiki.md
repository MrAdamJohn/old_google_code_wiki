# Phonegap
Phonegap is an HTML5 app platform that allows you to author native applications with web technologies and get access to APIs and app stores. Phonepap leverages web technologies developers already know best... HTML and JavaScript. Phonegap is available under Apache 2.0 license.

# GWT Phonegap
[gwt-phonegap](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-phonegap) provides access to the Phonegap API for GWT applications. In dev mode it can emulate the Phonegap API so that Phonegap apps can be developed inside a desktop browser.
gwt-phonegap is also available under Apache 2.0 license.

## Getting started
The wiki of the gwt-phonegap project contains the necessary steps on [how to get started](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-phonegap/wiki/GettingStarted).
