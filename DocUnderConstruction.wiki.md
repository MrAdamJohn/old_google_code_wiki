The GWT documentation is being updated to be compatible with the new [documentation view](http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-documentation-reader)) for projects hosted on Google Code.

Until that's ready, please refer to the [the existing GWT documentation](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/overview.html).
